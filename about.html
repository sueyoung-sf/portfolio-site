  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Hello. I'm Sue, a UX Designer with a graphic arts background. I've worked in CPG design for over 10 years and I find that my experience developing packaging translates easily into user centric design. From conducting competitive analyses to producing mockups and clickable prototypes, these UX tools have been in my skillset for years.
    </p>
    <p>My design style is simple and clean, minimalistic yet effective. I strive to create designs that are efficient, organized and surprise and delight users, while being easy to learn and use.
    </p>
    <p>Having been a part of small and large creative teams, I've learned to integrate quickly and work collaboratively or independently. My experience as a Peace Corps Volunteer deepened my love of travel, learning and growing from the challenges presented to me.
    </p>
    <p>I am a detail oriented, creative problem solver always looking for ways to make life a little easier, and ultimately, the world a little better.
    </p>
